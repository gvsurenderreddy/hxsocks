hxsocks
==================
a multi-user, PFS encrypted socks proxy.


## spec

The hxsocks protocol is similar to shadowsocks but better encrypted.

Below is the structure of a hxsocks request (sent from client-side).

## Handshake phase

    +--------------+------------+------------+----------------+----------+
    | Request Type | Time Stamp | Client Key | Authentication | Padding  |
    +--------------+------------+------------+----------------+----------+
    |       1      |     4      |  Variable  |       32       | Variable |
    +--------------+------------+------------+----------------+----------+

Request Type: 10
Time Stamp: struct.pack('>I', int(time.time()))
Client Key: ECDH key for key exchange, the first byte indicates the length.
Authentication: HMAC-SHA256 key is the user password, input is the time-stamp + client Key + client user name. Server should be able to figure who is the user.
Padding: random length padding, the first byte indicates the length.

    +--- -----------+----------------+------ ---+
    | Response Code | Authentication | Padding  |
    +------- -------+----------------+----------+
    |       1       |    Variable    | Variable |
    +------ --------+----------------+----------+

Response Code: 0x0 for success, other for failed.
Authentication: if authentication failed, this part is empty. if succeed, the authentication part is like this:

    +------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------+
    | Server Key | Authentication | Server Certificate | Signature |
    +------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------+
    |   Variable |        4       |      Variable      |  Variable |
    +------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------+

Server Key: for ECDH key exchange, the first byte indicates the length.
Authentication: HMAC-SHA256 key is the user password, input is the Client key + Server Key + Client user name, shows server indeed knows who is the user.
Server Certificate: Server public key, identifies the server, so others cannot pretend to be. the first byte indicates the length.
Signature: server signs the Authentication with Server Certificate private key. the first byte indicates the length.

Data transfered in handshake phase is encrypted with a pre-shared key, like behaved in shadowsocks.

At this phase, the client-side and server-side exchanged a encryption key for further use.

If the client-side already have a exchanged key, this step can be ignored.

## Connect Request

    +--------------+---------------+--------+------------------+----------+
    | Request Type | Client Key ID | Length |Real Request Info |   MAC    |
    +--------------+---------------+--------+------------------+----------+
    |       1      |        8      |   1    |     Variable     | Variable |
    +--------------+---------------+--------+------------------+----------+

Request Type: 11 for creating a new connection

Client Key ID: md5 digest for Client Key

Length: the length of Real Request Info

Request Type, Client Key ID and Length is encrypted with pre-shared key, while Real Request Info is encrypted with exchanged encryption key.

Real Request Info: contains actual connect info

    +------------+----------+------+----------+
    | Time Stamp | Hostname | Port | Padding  |
    +------------+----------+------+----------+
    |      4     | Variable |  2   | Variable |
    +------------+----------+------+----------+

the first byte of Hostname indicates the length.

MAC: the length of MAC is always equal to the encryption key length.

## Forward

The structure of a data chunk is shown below:

    +----------+----------+----------+
    | DATA.LEN |   DATA   |    MAC   |
    +----------+----------+----------+
    |     2    | Variable | Variable |
    +----------+----------+----------+

The DATA part is encrypted with exchanged key, structure is shown below:

    +-------------+----------+----------+
    | PADDING.LEN |   DATA   |  PADDING |
    +-------------+----------+----------+
    |      1      | Variable | Variable |
    +-------------+----------+----------+

if PADDING.LEN is 1, then the whole data part should be considered fake, and discarded.
